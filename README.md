# SportsPeak

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.0.

Sportâ€™s Peak is an Angular & JAVA Spring Boot application that aims to create custom exercises, sessions,
and sports programs, incorporating a performance log.
This project incorporates a community vision through the possibility for different users to share their
different programs, sessions and exercises, but also an educational vision through direct access to information
on the exercises, their purpose, the muscles requested, and their associated information.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
